      <h1>Observational Techniques in Astronomy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Curated resources for learning and teaching observational techniques in astronomy.
       Specifically, this focuses on classes targeted at upper-level undergraduates, usually those majoring or minoring in astronomy.
       Most of the courses taught in this context teach how to use a telescope, how to plan an observation, and how to obtain and analyze data.
       Most of those I've found focus on CCD astronomy, but some also include spectroscopy and radio astronomy.
